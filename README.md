## About This Handbook

We aim to present a straightforward guide to the quality control, data simulation and simulation quality assessment of individual-level pseudo GWAS data. Our handbook targets on beginners of GWAS simulation. Advanced users requiring more complex modeling strategies are recommended to consult software developerâ€™s websites to seek options that are more sophisticated. A brief list of these is provided in the [Data and Software Resources](#data-and-software-resources) section.

## Getting Started
### Install Software
Visit the SLiM official GitHub repository to download the latest version of the source code: https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/releases.  
Here I presented an example of installation using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in Linux, as GWAS simulations are heavy loading jobs and usually run on servers/high performance computing systems where Linux is widely used.
```ruby
wget https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/releases/download/v4.0.1/SLiM.zip
unzip ./SLiM.zip
cd SLiM
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make slim
#The executive will be created in the "build" folder.
```
If you are using other operating systems, please refer to chapter 2 in the [manual](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/releases/download/v4.0.1/SLiM_Manual.pdf). I also recommend MAC users/beginners to try [SLiM GUI](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/releases/download/v4.0.1/SLiM_OSX_Installer.pkg) as it comes with a straightforward debugging system.
### Reference Data
To simulate individual-level GWAS data, we need real samples as founders. Here, we recommend using the well-established 1000-genome project (1KGP), an open-access repository of whole-genome sequencing data of diverse populations (URL: https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/ftp/). You can use the code from the [data resources](#data-resources) section to download it.  
For simplicity, we used distinct ancestral subpopulations such as British from England and Scotland (GBR, N=91) as references. We created a subset of the dataset and performed pre-simulation quality control in the following steps:
* Select a subpopulation group and exclude IN/DELs.
```ruby
for chr in {1..22..1}; do vcftools --gzvcf ALL.chr$chr.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz --keep GBR.list.txt --remove-indels --mac 1 --recode --out ./GBR.chr$chr; done
#"GBR.list.txt" contains a list of family and individual IDs of GBR subpopulation.
#"--remove-indels" option removes all IN/DELs.
#"--mac 1" option removes monomorphic sites.
```
* Exclude multi-allelic sites and transfer data to Plink format
```ruby
for chr in {1..22..1};do plink2 --vcf GBR.chr$chr.vcf --export vcf --out GBR.chr$chr.clean --rm-dup force-first --max-alleles 2;done
#"--rm-dup force-first" option removes duplicate-ID variants and only keep the first instance of each.
#"--max-alleles 2" excludes multi-allelic variants with more than one minor allele.
```
* Clean ancestral sequence/FASTA data
The extracted reference nucleotide sequence contained many sites, particularly at the beginning and end of the chromosome, designated as N in the FASTA data, meaning that the nucleotide at that position is unknown. Besides, there are some M (bases with aMino groups) and R (bases with puRine) in chromosome 3. SLiM requires that the ancestral sequence be composed only of A/C/G/T nucleotides; N/M/R is not a legal option. For this reason, here we change all of those positions to A for SLiM to read; those sites were not involved in SNPs anyway, so this was harmless for our purposes here.
```ruby
for chr in {1..22..1};do sed -i 's/N/A/g' hs37d5_chr$chr.fa; done;sed -i 's/M/A/g' hs37d5_chr3.fa;sed -i 's/R/A/g' hs37d5_chr3.fa
#sed -i 's/N/A/g' replaced all "N"s with "A"s
#sed -i 's/M/A/g' replaced all "M"s with "A"s
#sed -i 's/R/A/g' replaced all "R"s with "A"s
```

### A quick Simulation
In this section, we performed a simple simulation using the smallest chromosome (chr22) and a small subset of GBR samples (N=30). In the mating model, we utilized Wright Fisher (WF) model and mated people randomly by ten generations. Controllers/parameters of the model are explained in the script.
```ruby
plink2 --vcf GBR.chr22.clean --keep GBR.30list.txt --mac 1 --out ./GBR.chr22.30.recode --export vcf
#"GBR.30list.txt" contains 30 family and individual IDs of GBR reference samples.
#Here, we created a subset vcf file of 30 reference GBR samples.
slim quick.txt
#Run the simulation code
plink2 --vcf GBR.input30.out50.gen10.chr22.vcf
#Show quick stats of the simulated individuals
```
As we set a fixed seed for randomization of the simulation example, you shall have 50 GBR samples with 104,915 variants simulated.

### Data resources
#### 1000G phase 3 reference data (2502 individuals)
You can download the open-access data from the [FTP server](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/).
A brief description of the data can be found in the [documentation](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/README_phase3_callset_20150220).
In Linux, you can download all VCF format data with FASTA format ancestral sequence using the following code:
```ruby
wget -r -np -nd ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/
#Download all VCF files and documentations
wget -r -np -nd ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/hs37d5.fa.gz
#Download the FASTA file
gzip -d hs37d5.fa.gz
#Unzip FASTA file
for chr in {1..22..1};do;samtools faidx hs37d5.fa "$chr" > hs37d5_chr$chr.fa;done
#Subset FASTA file by chromosomes
```

### Program sources (*All examples in this repository are run in Linux system*)
#### Plink and Plink2
[Plink 1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) and [Plink 2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) combined are used in this script.
Plink2 is an advanced version with lots of new features and most importantly runs faster.
However, it is still under development and [some modules such as fully-powered data merging are not available yet](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/#:~:text=its%20own%20score.-,Coming%20next,-Fully%2Dpowered%20merge).
Thus, we recommend to use Plink 1.9 for some basic data management process and only use Plink2 for new and fully-powered features.
